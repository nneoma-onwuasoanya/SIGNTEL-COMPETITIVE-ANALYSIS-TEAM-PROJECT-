# SIGNTEL COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS (TEAM-PROJECT)

### Executive Summary
As part of a team project, we conducted a competitive analysis of key players in the mobility and logistics space, including Bolt, Uber, Gokada, and Kwik. The objective was to understand how these companies position themselves, generate revenue, and compete in the market. My specific contribution focused on analyzing Uber’s business model, pricing strategy, and market positioning. The insights from this analysis helped identify opportunities for Signtel to differentiate itself and improve its competitive strategy.


### Problem Statement
The mobility and logistics industry is highly competitive, with multiple platforms offering similar services. For a company like Signtel to grow, it is important to understand how competitors operate and where opportunities exist.

This project aimed to answer key questions such as:
1. How do competitors attract and retain customers?
2.What pricing and revenue models do they use?
3. What are their strengths and weaknesses?
4. Where can Signtel differentiate itself?


### My Role and Contribution
Within the team, I was responsible for analyzing Uber.

My responsibilities included:
1. Researching Uber’s business model and operations
2. Analyzing its pricing and revenue structure
3. Identifying strengths and weaknesses
4. Documenting insights and strategic implications
5. Contributing to overall team recommendations


### Methodology
1. Structured competitor data using Excel
2. Conducted market and business model analysis
3. Compared competitors across key areas: Value proposition, Pricing strategy, Revenue model, and Geographic reach
4. Synthesized findings into insights and recommendations


## Focus Company: Uber
Value Proposition
Uber positions itself as a convenient and reliable transportation solution, offering users easy access to rides through its mobile platform.


### Pricing Strategy

Uber uses a dynamic pricing model, which includes:

Base fare

Distance-based charges

Time-based charges

Surge pricing during high demand

This model allows Uber to balance supply and demand, but can result in higher prices for users.


### Revenue Model
Uber generates revenue primarily through:

Commission on driver earnings (typically 20–25%)

Service fees charged to users

This model ensures scalability but can create pressure on driver earnings.


### Geographic Reach
Uber operates in multiple countries and major cities, giving it:

Strong brand recognition

Large user base

Global market presence


### Strengths

Strong global brand

Large and active user base

Advanced app and technology

Efficient matching of riders and drivers


### Weaknesses

High competition from lower-cost platforms

Driver dissatisfaction due to commission structure

Price sensitivity among users


### Key Insights

Uber’s strength lies in scale, technology, and convenience

Dynamic pricing helps optimize demand but can affect customer satisfaction

Driver retention is a key challenge due to commission rates

Price competition remains a major factor in the market


### Recommendations for Signtel

Based on the analysis:

Differentiate on trust and security, not just price

Offer fairer commission structures to attract drivers

Focus on underserved markets with less competition

Ensure consistent and reliable service delivery

Leverage data to optimize pricing and operations


### Skills Demonstrated

Competitive Analysis

Market Research

Business Strategy Thinking

### Limitations

Analysis based on secondary research

Limited access to internal company data

Market conditions may change over time


### What I Learned
This project helped me understand how to break down a company’s strategy into clear components and connect those insights to real business decisions. It also improved my ability to work collaboratively while contributing meaningful individual analysis.
